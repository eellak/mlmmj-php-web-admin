To use this web-interface you have to:

1) Copy the files from the php-admin directory of the mlmmj distribution to a
   suitable location and point your webroot to the htdocs directory. If you
   don't want the webinterface in the root of your website it is recommended to
   make an alias in your web server configuration in order to keep the conf
   directory at the same level as the htdocs directory and still outside
   webscope. If you want to keep it somewhere else, you will need to modify
   the first line of code in index.php, edit.php and save.php.

2) If your lists are stored somewhere other than /var/spool/mlmmj, edit
   conf/config.php to reflect this.

3) Change the permissions of the listdir/control directories of any list you
   want to control using the web-interface, so the web server can write in it:

     # chown -R wwwrun /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/control/

4) If the web server does not run as the same user the mailserver writes as
   you need to create a group (eg. mlmmj) and add both users to it. The
   subscribers.d directory then needs to be writable by that group:

     # addgroup mlmmj
     # adduser wwwrun mlmmj
     # adduser mailuser mlmmj
     # chgrp -R mlmmj /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/subscribers.d/
     # chmod -R g+w /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/subscribers.d/
     # chmod g+s /var/spool/mlmmj/mlmmj-test/subscribers.d/

   setgid flag is needed when the webserver calls mlmmj-sub and creates a file
   under subscribers.d, to keep the mlmmj group.

   If using the Exim mailserver, you should add initgroups = true in your
   mlmmj_transport, otherwise it won't be able to write files having write
   permission to mlmmj group.

5) To enable access control on Apache you have to rename dot.htaccess to
   .htaccess and edit the path inside the file to point to a htpasswd file
   somewhere outside the webscope.

   If you don't have one already, you can create one like this

      htpasswd -c /home/mlmmj/htpasswd USER

   It will then ask you for a password for the given username.

6) That is it, you are ready to use the interface.
